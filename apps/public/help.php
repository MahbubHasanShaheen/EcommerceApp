A. Well, that is up to you but you can also be a couch potato like our founders and have your items delivered to your house for free. Our prices are sometimes lower than that of major superstores in the city. We also carry a larger variety than the average corner-store. So, there is really no reason to not buy from us.

We will not accept any diaper items as return if more than 20% of the pack has been used. We reserve the right to refuse refund. Please contact us at 01919-123123 if you want to return an item.
Q. What is your discounting policy?
A. We try to provide the best deals in Dhaka and many of our products are already discounted below the maximum retail price (MRP). We also offer discount codes under special circumstances, which are applied on the MRP. On any given product, we can only apply one type of discount. We always consider the best discount available to the customer. For example: If the MRP of a product is Tk. 100 and our list price is Tk. 92 -- the product is already sold at a 8% discount. This means that if user applies a discount code for 5% discount, we will still consider the best discount available to the user and sell the product at Tk. 92.

A. Absolutely. Our hotline is 01919-123123

A. We try our best to source the best quality items for you but if you are dissatisfied, you can always send them back with the delivery person. If you forget to do that, you can call us within 3 days and we will replace the item for free.
Q. How are you sourcing your products?
A. We have deals with whole-sellers, manufacturers and importers. We only sell authentic products.
