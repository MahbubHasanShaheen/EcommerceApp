<h5>Product Descriptions:</h5>
<p>Chaldal attempts to be as accurate as possible. Chaldal does not manufacture or produce any product by themselves.

If the MRP (Maximum Retail Price) of an item sold by Chaldal is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
